<h2>1 Menus for different macro edits</h2>
The first menu is reserved for randomized patch generation. There are synth categories under that menu and when one of the items is selected, a synth sound according to that category is created.
<br/><br/>
The second menu is used for different utility tools for e.g. tempo syncing and easy sculpting of sound.
<br/><br/>
The last menu is for other macros such as copying synth engines from one into another.
<h2>2 Display for selected ROM-samples for each synth engine.</h2>
<h2>3.1 - 3.3 Individual synth engines</h2>
<h4>Bank</h4>
Select sample category.
<h4>Patch</h4>
Select sample.
<h4>Looping</h4>
Looping mode.
<ul>
<li>No
<br/>
- The sample will play once from start to end.
</li>
<li>Yes
<br/>
- The sample will play from start to the loop end point and then jump back to the loop start point.
After the note is realeased the sample will play normally to the end.</li>
<li>Release
<br/>
- The sample will play from start to the loop end point and then jump back to the loop start point.
After the note is released the looping will continue but only the volume is decreased gradually.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cue</h4>
The loop position relative to the original looping position and the sample length.
When cue is 0 the looping position is at the original position, when it is increased the looping position will
shift further in time wrapping around in the end of the sample and finally ending up to the starting position at value 1.
<h4>Octave</h4>
Octave shift for the sample, range from -3 to 3.
<h4>Detune</h4>
Detune +-50 cents.
<h4>Cutoff</h4>
Cutoff frequency of the modeled MS20 low pass filter.
<h4>Peaking</h4>
Peaking/resonance amount.
<h4>Distort<h4/>
Hard clipping distortion amount. 0 is completely clean tone, 1 is clipping at around -30 dB level.
<h4>Attack</h4>
Envelope attack. Linear curve, range 0...4 seconds. By default envelope controls only the volume.
<h4>Decay</h4>
Envelope decay. Linear curve, range 0...4 seconds. By default envelope controls only the volume.
<h4>Sustain</h4>
Envelope sustain level. By default envelope controls only the volume.
<h4>Tail</h4>
<ul>
<li>
If looping mode is No or Yes tail is an exponentially decreasing multiplier applied to the volume
after note release to make it possible to reduce the predefined release from the sample.
</li><li>
If looping mode is Release, tail is envelope release. Linear curve, range 0...4 seconds.
</li>
 By default envelope controls only the volume.
</ul>
<h4>E->Filter</h4>
Send amount from envelope to filter cutoff.
<h4>Type</h4>
LFO waveform:
<ul>
<li>SINE = sine wave</li>
<li>TRI = triangle wave</li>
<li>SAW = sawtooth wave</li>
<li>SQR = square wave</li>
<li>SIN3 = sine wave to the power of 3</li>
<li>S.SAW = smoothened (low pass filtered) sawtooth wave</li>
<li>S.SQR = smoothened (low pass filtered) square wave</li>
<li>NOISE = white noise</li>
</ul>
<h4>Rate</h4>
LFO rate in Hz.
<h4>L->Pitch</h4>
Send amount from LFO to oscillator pitch.
<h4>L->Cue</h4>
Send amount from LFO to the loop position.
<h4>L->Filter</h4>
Send amount from LFO to filter cutoff.
<h4>L->Level</h4>
Send amount from LFO to volume.
<h4>L->Pan</h4>
Panning, +-100% where 0 is at center, -100 hard left and 100 hard right
<h4>Level</h4>
The volume. If volume is set to 0 the oscillator is disabled.

<h2>4 Global controls</h2>

<h4>Level</h4>
Total volume of the synth.

<h4>Unison</h4>
Unison count.

<h4>UDetune</h4>
Unison detune in cents.

<h4>DelayTm</h4>
Delay time in milliseconds.

<h4>DlyFeed</h4>
Delay feedback amount.

<h4>DlyWet</h4>
Delay wet signal blend amount to dry signal.

<h4>OscSeq</h4>
Sequencing mode. "Layered" means that on note on all the synth engines play a note, in other modes only one of the synth engines play a note.

<h4>SoftClp</h4>
"Soft" clipping applied to the master signal.

<h4>FlngFrq</h4>
Flanger oscillator frequency in Hz.

<h4>FlngDly</h4>
Flanger delay amount.

<h4>FlngDpt</h4>
Flanger modulation depth.

<h4>FlngWet</h4>
Flanger wet signal blend amount to dry signal.

<h4>LfoFreq</h4>
Global LFO frequency.

<h4>LfoType</h4>
LFO waveform type. Same options as for synth engine specific LFO.

<h4>L2Pan</h4>
Send amount from LFO to panning.

<h4>L2Level</h4>
Send amount from LFO to synth output volume.

<h4>L2Delay</h4>
Send amount from LFO to delay wet signal blend amount.

<h4>L2Flang</h4>
Send amount from LFO to flanger wet signal blend amount.

<h4>LowCut</h4>
Highpass filter frequency.

<h4>L2LFOs</h4>
Send amount from LFO to synth engine specific LFOs.

<h4>L2Clip</h4>
Send amount from LFO to soft clip amount.

<h4>LStereo</h4>
Stereo offset for LFO (where applicable).
